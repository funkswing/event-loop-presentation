<Steps
    length={2}

    )}

<Notes>
  
  - Event loop can be visualized like so

  - Next slide: better to show it like this

  - Next slide: or maybe like Life Cycle Events

  - Next slide: Event Loop is a flat circle

## Basics

<ul>
    <Appear>
        <li>NodeJS / V8 is single threaded</li>
        <li>Async = non-blocking</li>
        <li>Promises are async</li>
        <ul>
            <li>but are they non-blocking?</li>

  - Using this visualization of the Event Loop

  - Go over each "Phase"

</Notes>

---

<Split>

## Phases - Timers
  
  - setTimeout() / setInterval() calls
    - Timer ms must have passed before evaluating
  - Evaluated once per loop in NodeJS
    - Brower handles this differently (but that's a different talk)
  - `setTimeout(, 0)` === `setTimeout(, 1)`
    - Always at least 1ms wait

</Split>

<Split>

![](./static/el3.png)

## Phases - Poll

  - nextTick / micro tasks
    - "micro tasks" = Promise callbacks
  - Occurs between each Event Loop "Phase"
    - Node v11 and up handles this differently ðŸ˜±
  - Phase ends when queue exhausted
  - Reolved Pomises in this phase are added back into this queue
    - Can result in "I/0 starvation", e.g. blocking the event loop

</Split>

<Split>

## Phases - I/O

  - e.g. handle incoming API requests, disk I/O, DNS lookups
  - Complex and varies based on host OS

</Split>

---

<Split>

![](./static/el3.png)

## Phases - Immediates

  - setImmediate() calls
  - Callbacks added to setImmediate queue during this phase will be evaluated on next pass of the event loop

</Split>

---

<Split>

![](./static/el3.png)

## Phases - Close Handlers

  - process.exit() and crashes of NodeJS process
  - Important for scripts, but generally not important in context of an API server
  - Last opportunity to cleanup before Node process is terminated
    - e.g. Draining database connections

</Split>

## Async Resolution Order

_DEMO: Promise.resolve / setTimeout / setImmediate_

<Notes>
    - Browser: nextTick callbacks and microtasks will run between each individual setTimeout and setImmediate callbacks

# Demo

## Blocking Event Loop

## with Promises

<Notes>
    demo blocking event loop on API server here and how to solve it

    Ping API server every second:
    while true; do date && curl -m 5 http://localhost:5000/api/auth && echo; sleep 1; done

    
    Blocking v Non-Blocking API requests:
    START=$(date +%s) && curl http://localhost:3000/loop && END=$(date +%s) && echo "Took: $(expr $END - $START) sec"
    START=$(date +%s) && curl http://localhost:3000/loop/bmap && END=$(date +%s) && echo "Took: $(expr $END - $START) sec"
    START=$(date +%s) && curl http://localhost:3000/loop/seti && END=$(date +%s) && echo "Took: $(expr $END - $START) sec"
    START=$(date +%s) && curl http://localhost:3000/loop/bird && END=$(date +%s) && echo "Took: $(expr $END - $START) sec"
    START=$(date +%s) && curl http://localhost:3000/loop/native && END=$(date +%s) && echo "Took: $(expr $END - $START) sec"
    START=$(date +%s) && curl http://localhost:3000/loop/sett && END=$(date +%s) && echo "Took: $(expr $END - $START) sec"
